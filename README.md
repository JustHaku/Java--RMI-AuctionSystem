# Java--RMI-AuctionSystem
An implementation of a secure auction system that utilizes java RMI and uses crytographic encryption to authorize users.

This project is an implementation of a distributed auctioning system where users can list items they wish to sell and bid on items sold by others.

The auctioning server has been implemented to deal with requests from the two client programs and maintain the state of the ongoing auctions. 
The system also supports multiple seller and buyer clients creating listings or bidding simultaneously.

Bid Clients are used to buy items from sellers in the auction system.
Sell Clients are used to list items to be sold in the auction system.

To launch the system, the auction server should be ran first.
